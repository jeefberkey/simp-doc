Apply Certificates
++++++++++++++++++

All clients in a SIMP system must have :term:`Public Key Infrastructure` (PKI)
keypairs generated for the server.  These keys reside in the
``/var/simp/environments/simp/site_files/pki_files/files/keydist`` directory  on the
SIMP server and are served to the clients over the puppet protocol.

.. NOTE::

  These keypairs are **not** the keys that the Puppet server uses for its
  operation. Do not get the two confused.

This section provides guidance on installing official certificates or, as
an interim measure, generating certificates from the Fake (self-signing)
Certificate Authority provided by SIMP.

Installing Official Certificates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below are the steps to install official certificates for a SIMP client on
the SIMP server:

1. Copy the certificates received from a proper :term:`CA` to the SIMP server.
2. Add the keys for the node to ``/var/simp/environments/simp/site_files/pki_files/files/keydist``.

  a) Type ``mkdir -p /var/simp/environments/simp/site_files/pki_files/files/keydist/***<Client System FQDN>***``
  b) Type

     .. code-block:: bash

       mv ***<Certificate Directory>***/***<FQDN>***.[pem|pub] \
       /var/simp/environments/simp/site_files/pki_files/files/keydist/***<FQDN>***

  c) Type ``chown -R root.puppet /var/simp/environments/simp/site_files/pki_files/files/keydist``
  d) Type ``chmod -R u=rwX,g=rX,o-rwx /var/simp/environments/simp/site_files/pki_files/files/keydist``

3. Create and populate the ``/var/simp/environments/simp/site_files/pki_files/files/keydist/cacerts``
   directory.

  a) Type ``cd /var/simp/environments/simp/site_files/pki_files/files/keydist``
  b) Type ``mkdir cacerts`` and copy the root CA public certificates into cacerts in Privacy
     Enhanced Mail (PEM) format (one per file).
  c) Type ``cd cacerts``
  d) Type ``for file in *.pem; do ln -s $file `openssl x509 -in $file -hash -noout`.0; done``

Generating Certificates from the Fake CA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If server certificates have not or could not be obtained at the time of client
installation, SIMP provides a way to create them for the system, so that it
will work until proper certificates are provided.

.. NOTE::

  This option should not be used for any operational system that can use proper
  enterprise PKI certificates.

Below are the steps to generate the certificates using the SIMP-provided, Fake CA.

1. Type ``cd /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/simp/FakeCA``
2. Type ``vi togen``
3. Remove old entries from the file and add the :term:`Fully Qualified Domain Name`
   (FQDN) of the systems (one per line) for which certificates will be created.

  .. NOTE::

    To use alternate DNS names for the same system, separate the names with
    commas and without spaces.

    For example, ``.name,alt.name1,alt.name2.``

4. Type ``wc cacertkey``

  .. NOTE::

    Ensure that the ``cacertkey`` file is not empty. If it is, enter text into
    the file; then save and close the file.

5. Type ``./gencerts_nopass.sh auto``

  .. NOTE::

    To avoid using the default Fake CA values, remove the ``auto`` statement
    from the ``./gencerts_nopass.sh`` command.

.. WARNING::

  If the ``clean.sh`` command is run after the certificates have been
  generated, you will not be able to generate new host certificates under the
  old CA. To troubleshoot certificate problems, see the
  :ref:`cm-troubleshoot-cert-issues` section.

If issues arise while generating keys, type ``cd /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/simp/FakeCA``
to navigate to the ``/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/simp/FakeCA`` directory, then type
``./clean.sh`` to start over.

After running the ``clean.sh`` script, type ``./gencerts_nopass.sh`` to
run the script again using the previous procedure table.
