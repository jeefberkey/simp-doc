Getting Started
---------------

This document provides a quick overview of how to get started with building and
setting up your SIMP environment.

Please be aware that this is a snapshot in time and, while it should remain
accurate, if you find any issues, please check the `SIMP How-To Articles`_ on
the `SIMP Confluence Page`_.

Once you're done setting up your environment, you should proceed to the
:ref:`simp-user-guide` for utilizing SIMP to its full potential.

If issues still remain, please drop us a line on the `SIMP Development Mailing List`_.

.. NOTE::
  The fastest method for getting started with SIMP is to follow the
  :ref:`gsg-installing_simp_from_a_repository` guide.

  This is the method that you want to use if you are installing on any sort of
  existing system.

.. NOTE::
  If you need to build an ISO, you should follow the
  :ref:`gsg-building_simp_from_tarball` guide.
