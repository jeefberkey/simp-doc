Puppet Server Behind a NAT
==========================

This section provides guidance for when the Puppet server is behind a
NAT but is managing hosts outside the NAT.

To resolve this issue, open the ``/etc/puppet/manifests/vars.pp`` file and
rename the ``puppet_servers`` variable to
``puppet\_server\_hosts\_mod``. Then, create a new ``$puppet_servers``
variable and point it to ``template('site/nat_ip_switch.erb')``.

The entries in ``vars.pp`` should look like the following example.

Example Sample Entries in ``vars.pp``

.. code-block:: ruby

  $puppet_server_hosts_mod = "puppet.$dns_domain|1.2.3.4 puppet2.$dns_domain|2.3.4.5"
  $puppet_servers = template('site/nat_ip_switch.erb')


Create a ``/etc/puppet/modules/site/templates/nat_ip_switch.erb`` file
with the content shown in the next example. Change the appropriate
portions of the content to meet the needs of the user environment.

.. important::

    Ensure that the ``.erb`` file is owned by *root.puppet* and mode
    *640*.

Source Create the ``nat_ip_switch.erb``

.. code-block:: ruby

  <%
  # Edit this variable to provide the IP address mappings.
  # The left-hand side should contain the internal addresses.
  # The right-hand side should contain the external addresses.
  t_ipmap = {
      "1.2.3.4" => "10.10.10.10",
      "2.3.4.5" => '10.2.3.4'
  }

  # Edit this regex to match the hosts.
  # This is done with a Regexp; the user can use whichever is preferred.
  # Pure IP matching would be faster using the IPAddr class.
  t_inside_nets = Regexp.new("^5\.*")

  t_pupsrvs = puppet_server_hosts_mod.split(/\s|,|;/)

  # Change the ipaddress variable to the host that the regexp above is matching.
  if not t_inside_nets.match(ipaddress) then
    t_pupsrvs.each_index do |t_i|
      t_vals = t_pupsrvs[t_i].split(/\|/)
      if t_ipmap.include?(t_vals.last) then
        t_vals[-1] = t_ipmap[t_vals.last]
        t_pupsrvs[t_i] = t_vals.join('|')
      end
    end

    t_pupsrvs = t_pupsrvs.join(' ')
  end
  -%>
  <%= t_pupsrvs -%>


Run ``puppet agent -t`` on the client to receive the appropriately
mapped NAT address of the Puppet server.

If the user cannot connect to the NAT'd Puppet server, change the values
in the ``/etc/hosts`` directory to the correct values and try running
``puppet agent -t`` again.
