SSH Keys with Puppet
====================

This section provides guidance on managing a local service account, and
propagating keys and sudo permissions for the user via Puppet.

Resource Setup
--------------

In cases where there is a need to SSH to a target machine/VM as a local
user, there are several items that need to be addressed prior to
experiencing a successful connection. First, the group account must
exist locally, as well as the local user (belonging to the respective
account). PAM must allow the desired group access to the machine/VM, and
keys must be put in the correct directories to allow the user access.

The below code is a template to make this happen, with explanations of
the generic variables included, as well as 2048-bit :term:`RSA` key generation.

Code to Set Up a Local User SSH Connection Examples

.. code-block:: ruby

  class <CLASS NAME> {
    include "ssh"

    group { "<GROUP NAME>":
      gid => "<GROUP ID NUMBER>",
      allowdupe => false,
      ensure => present,
    }

    user { "<USER NAME>":
      uid => "<USER ID NUMBER>",
      allowdupe => false,
      ensure => present,
      gid => "<GROUP NAME>",
      home => "/srv/<USER NAME>",
      managehome => true,
      shell => "/bin/sh",
      require => Group["<GROUP NAME>"]
    }

    file { "/srv/<USER NAME>/.ssh":
      owner => "<USER NAME>",
      group => "<GROUP NAME>",
      mode => "700",
      ensure => directory,
    }

    ssh_authorized_key { "<USER NAME>":
      type => "ssh-rsa",
      key => ssh_autokey( "<USER NAME>", "2048" ),
      target =>"/srv/<USER NAME>/.ssh/authorized_keys",
      require => [
        File["/srv/<USER NAME>/.ssh"],
        User["<USER NAME>"]
      ]
    }

    file { "/srv/<USER NAME>/.ssh/id_rsa":
      mode => "600",
      owner => "<USER NAME>",
      group => "<GROUP NAME>",
      source =>"puppet://$puppet_server/site/ssh_autokeys/<USER NAME>",
      require => Ssh_authorized_key["<USER NAME>"]
    }

    file { "/etc/ssh/local_keys/<USER NAME>":
      ensure => present,
      owner => "root",
      group => "root",
      mode => "644"
      source =>"puppet://$puppet_server/site/ssh_autokeys/<USER NAME>.pub",
      require => Ssh_authorized_key["<USER NAME>"]
    }

    sudo::user_specification { "<USER NAME>":
      user_list => ["<USERN AME>"],
      host_list => "<HOST>",
      runas => "<RUN AS>",
      cmnd => ["<COMMAND LIST>"],
      passwd => "false",
      require => User["<USER NAME>"]
    }

    pam::access::manage { "Allow <USER NAME>":
      users => <USER NAME>,
      origins => ['ALL']
    }
  }


Variables

The table below provides explanations of the variables included in the
template code in the previous section.

<GROUP NAME>      Name of the local group to which the user belongs
<HOST>            Host on which the sudo commands apply
<USER NAME>       Name of the local service account user
<USER ID NUMBER>  Numerical ID of the user

Testing
-------

The table below lists the steps to test that the configuration was
applied correctly.

1. Log on to a server that has the template code configuration applied.
2. Type ``su - ***<USER NAME>***``
3. Type ``exec /usr/bin/ssh-agent /bin/bash`` to ensure that ssh-agent has a shell running.
4. Type ``/usr/bin/ssh-add`` to attach the user's certificates.
5. **Optional**: Type ``/usr/bin/ssh-add -l`` to double check that the user's certificates were added successfully.
6. Type ``ssh ***<HOST>***`` to SSH to a target machine that has the template code configuration applied.

Table: Test the Configuration Procedure

If successful, the user should be authenticated and gain access to the
target machine without entering a password. If the user is prompted for
a password, check to see if the permissions are set up properly and that
the certificate keys are in the correct locations. In addition, check
the ``/etc/security/access.conf`` file to ensure that it contains the user
or user's group in an allow statement. See ``access.conf(5)`` for details.
